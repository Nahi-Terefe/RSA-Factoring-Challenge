# RSA-Factoring-Challenge
  - Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
  - RSA Laboratories states that: for each RSA number n, there exist prime numbers p and q such that
    n = p Ã— q. The problem is to find these two primes, given only n.

## Description of what each file shows:
* factors - the program to factorize (Usage: time ./factors tests/test00)
* tests/test00 - the file with the numbers
### Environment
* Language: Bash script
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
